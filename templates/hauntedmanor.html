    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitama-op/httptest/main/images/hauntedmanor.jpg" alt="The Jungle Rescue">
    <p>In the heart of the dense, wild jungle, there was a group of brave explorers.</p>
    <p>Led by Captain Lara, they were on a mission to rescue a scientist who had been lost deep within the jungle. The jungle was filled with danger—ferocious animals, treacherous rivers, and hidden traps.</p>
    <p>As they made their way through the thick vegetation, the team suddenly heard a loud roar. It was a giant tiger blocking their path! Without hesitation, Captain Lara grabbed her tranquilizer gun and aimed carefully. The tiger lunged, but she fired just in time, and the beast fell asleep, allowing the team to pass safely.</p>
    <p>The journey wasn’t over yet. The explorers had to cross a rickety bridge over a raging river. Just as they were halfway across, the bridge began to collapse! Thinking quickly, Captain Lara threw a rope to the other side, and one by one, they swung to safety.</p>
    <p>Finally, after hours of navigating the dangerous jungle, they found the lost scientist trapped in a cave guarded by a huge python. Captain Lara devised a plan. She used a flare to distract the python while the team rescued the scientist.</p>
    <p>With the scientist safe, the team raced back to their helicopter, narrowly escaping the jungle as night fell. They had faced the dangers head-on and emerged victorious.</p>
    <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
