    <p>On the outskirts of a small, forgotten town stood an old, crumbling manor known as Blackwood House.</p>
    <p>Locals whispered that the house was cursed, haunted by the spirits of those who had vanished within its walls. No one dared to go near it—except for a group of friends who were drawn by the stories.</p>
    <p>One stormy night, the friends—Sarah, Tom, and Emily—decided to explore Blackwood House. As they approached the front door, it creaked open on its own. A cold wind blew out, sending chills down their spines.</p>
    <p>Inside, the air was thick with dust and the smell of decay. The floorboards groaned under their feet as they wandered through the dark, empty rooms. Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind them, trapping them inside.</p>
    <p>Sarah's flashlight flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls. They heard footsteps upstairs—heavy, dragging footsteps. The friends exchanged terrified glances but felt compelled to find out what was making the noise.</p>
    <p>As they climbed the grand staircase, the temperature dropped sharply. They reached the top and saw a long, dark hallway with a single door at the end. The footsteps stopped as they approached the door.</p>
    <p>Tom pushed it open, revealing a room filled with old, dusty furniture covered in white sheets. In the center of the room was an antique mirror, and as they stared into it, they saw something move behind them—something that wasn't there when they turned around.</p>
    <p>A ghostly figure appeared in the reflection, its face twisted in a silent scream. The friends tried to run, but the door slammed shut, trapping them in the room. The ghost stepped out of the mirror, reaching for them with cold, bony hands.</p>
    <p>The last thing they heard was a whisper in the dark: "You should never have come here."</p>
    <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
